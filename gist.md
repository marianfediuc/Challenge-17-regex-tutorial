## Summary

This tutorials purpose is to present and explain how a specific regular expression (Regex) is working, by breaking down each part of the expression and describing what it does.

## Regex Components


### Anchors A descrip

    Anchors belong to the family of regex tokens that don't match any characters, but that assert something about the string or the matching process. An Assertion is a Regular Expression that either succeeds (if a match is found) or fails (if a match is not found).

### Quantifiers

    Quantifiers specify how many instances of a character, group, or character class must be present in the input for a match to be found.

### Grouping and Capturing

    Groups group multiple patterns as a whole, and capturing groups provide extra submatch information when using a regular expression pattern to match against a string.

### Bracket Expressions

    Bracket expressions are a list of characters and/or character classes enclosed in brackets

### Character Classes
    With a “character class”, also called “character set”, you can tell the regex engine to match only one out of several characters. Simply place the characters you want to match between square brackets

### The OR Operator
    The | sign indicates an OR operator. For example: couch|chair finds couch or chair.

### Flags
    Regular expressions have optional flags that allow for functionality like global searching and case-insensitive searching. These flags can be used separately or together in any order, and are included as part of the regular expression

### Character Escapes
    If you need to use any of the special characters literally (actually searching for a "*", for instance), you must escape it by putting a backslash in front of it
